Due to this effect, the glaciers in Olympic are growing smaller. Plants and animals, as well as humans, are also affected by this change because a smaller snowpack means less water melting through the spring and summer. Also, the peak flow through rivers will occur at a different time of the year, which will affect plants and animals the depend on water during a specific season.

Congress decided to create Yellowstone in an Act on March 1, 1872 so that the public could enjoy the scenic land in its natural state. This Act paved the way for countries all over the world to create similar parks to protect the natural environment.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over the next few decades, other lands in the US were added to this collection of federally protected parks, but there was no single organization that took care of all these different lands. On August 25th 1916, President Woodrow Wilson created the National Park Service to oversee all of the national parks and monuments. This act was called the Organic Act, and its goal was to create the National Park Service to preserve these lands so that they could be enjoyed by the public as well as future generations.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img src=\"../assets/wiki/wilson.png\" />\r\n          <p>\r\n            <i>Image from US Library of Congress</i>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Actions from the President continued to affect the growth of the National Park Service. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt added 56 sites that had been maintained by other government agencies to the National Park System (Executive Order in 1933). This act added sites to the National Park System that were not only beautiful, but that were also important historically and scientifically.\r\nToday the National Park System includes over 400 different lands across more than 84 million acres in 50 states and US territories. These different parks and monuments have been added to the System over time through acts of Congress. Congress is advised by the National Park Service itself as to what additions and changes should be made to the System. The President does not have the authority to create National Parks, but can declare land that is already federally controlled to be a National Monument (Antiquities Act of 1906).\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over 20,000 employees work for the National Park Service today.

Climate change refers to a significant long-term shift in weather variables and includes not only shifts in mean conditions (e.g., increasing average annual temperature and sea level) but also changes in climate variability (e.g., more intense storms and flooding). The human impact of burning fossil fuels is causing changes in the global climate that are out of the ordinary as compared to the cycles of ice ages that have been occurring over the past millions of years.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Olympic National Park, like ecosystems everywhere on the planet, is affected by a changing climate. One major change is that of water. With warmer winters, more rain falls rather than snow, which runs off the slopes instead of contributing to snowpack to feed glaciers. Due to this effect, the glaciers in Olympic are growing smaller. Plants and animals, as well as humans, are also affected by this change because a smaller snowpack means less water melting through the spring and summer. Also, the peak flow through rivers will occur at a different time of the year, which will affect plants and animals the depend on water during a specific season. Trees may be further affected because with warmer temperatures forest fires and various tree pests and diseases will likely increase.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Today, park managers are faced with many decisions about how to maintain the park and the ecosystems it contains to help protect plants and animals in the face of changing climate. These decisions cover many issues, including how to manage roads and trails, plant and animal species, and human impacts on the park, among many others.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/upload/weather-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Adapted from National Park Service</a>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n    name: 'RangerWiki',\r\n    props: ['shown', 'ondismiss'],\r\n    data() {\r\n      return {\r\n        selected: 0\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style lang=\"scss\" scoped>\r\n  .ranger-wiki-container {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    bottom: 0;\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\r\n    z-index: 999;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n\r\n    .ranger-wiki {\r\n      background-image: url('../assets/ui/ranger-wiki-bg.png');\r\n      width: 800px;\r\n      height: 600px;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      flex-direction: row;\r\n\r\n      .sections, .content {\r\n        width: 323px;\r\n        margin-left: 55px;\r\n        margin-top: 60px;\r\n        margin-bottom: 60px;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      .sections .btn {\r\n        cursor: pointer;\r\n\r\n        &.selected {\r\n          color: blue;\r\n          font-weight: bold;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        &:hover {\r\n          text-decoration: underline;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      .content .text {\r\n        overflow-y: scroll;\r\n        overflow-x: hidden;\r\n        height: 450px;\r\n        text-align: left;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      .content img {\r\n        max-width: 100%;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/common/RangerWiki.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return (_vm.shown)?_c('div',{staticClass:\"ranger-wiki-container\",on:{\"click\":_vm.ondismiss}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"ranger-wiki\",on:{\"click\":function($event){$event.stopPropagation();(function () {})($event)}}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"sections\"},[_c('b',[_vm._v(\"Topics\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"btn\",class:{ selected: _vm.selected == 0 },on:{\"click\":function($event){_vm.selected = 0}}},[_vm._v(\"Park History\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"btn\",class:{ selected: _vm.selected == 1 },on:{\"click\":function($event){_vm.selected = 1}}},[_vm._v(\"Invasive Species\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"btn\",class:{ selected: _vm.selected == 2 },on:{\"click\":function($event){_vm.selected = 2}}},[_vm._v(\"River\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"btn\",class:{ selected: _vm.selected == 3 },on:{\"click\":function($event){_vm.selected = 3}}},[_vm._v(\"Climate Change\")])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"content\"},[(_vm.selected == 0)?_c('div',{staticClass:\"text\"},[_c('b',[_vm._v(\"Park History\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"\\n            The first national park in the United States was Yellowstone National Park, located in Montana and Wyoming, before they had even become states.
