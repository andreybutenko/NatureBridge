music switchScenepickaxes
I’ve uploaded the code for the old equipment scene HT3.
I’ve also uploaded icons for the bird (for MT2) and the pick axe/hammer (for HT2). Is it possible for you to insert these icons directly into those scenes? The pick axe can be part of the background layer for that scene. But the bird will need to appear and disappear when it shows up in the dialogue.
